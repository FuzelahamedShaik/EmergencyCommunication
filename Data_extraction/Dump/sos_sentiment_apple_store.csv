0,Flane68,It seems really good but I'm missing ONE thing that I saw right away and that's a widget for it for quick access on lock screen.,4,26-08-2019,-1
1,Golihat,"The app would have been great if it wasn't so limited.
This is just one of the few things that must be implemented immediately:

To be able to search in areas and get real-time information.

Being able to share your position through registration when you call 112 (without calling via the app) should be a matter of course, but does not currently exist. Would make it easier for both users and staff at SOS.

Adding a Message function, for those who need to contact 112 in silence or are unable to speak.

Multilingual support and selectable in settings.

Be able to delete messages you have already read and do not want to see.

Be able to see the history of events in the area you searched for/are in, 24 hours back in time.

Make sure the servers are working 100% as the app often loses communication with the information flow.",3,26-08-2019,1
2,stinade,"The top with an app that shows location. But I, as a hearing impaired person who has been granted the option to text 112 instead of calling, would like to be able to do that via the app as well.",4,26-08-2019,1

9,MacMarsl,"After the last automatic update, I can't use the app anymore on my Iphone 6. Without explanation what's wrong, I can only guess that users of older smartphones are not welcome. Shame, because I've been really happy with the app otherwise and have recommended others to get it.
Tip: You can keep the older version of the app for those who don't want or can buy the latest over the phone.",1,25-12-2021,1
10,fijcfrhj,"Always when I get a ""ping"" about a new event and a notice on the screen, I go into the app but there it says the top of the green field ""no current events"". Clicks on that text and comes to current events where there is indeed an event.
Going back to the start page and now it says in red ""(a) current event"".
Have submitted an error report via the app about this but received the reply that completed events are not visible on the home page.
But these are _current_ events that are not visible on the start page.
In the beginning I missed a lot of info because it incorrectly stated that there were no current events.",3,25-01-2023,-1

12,Vilsen jurist,"The only thing that works in the app is to call 112, which feels quite far-fetched to enter via the app instead of dialing 112?

There are NEVER any current events, although things are happening all the time.

Right now, there is an ongoing fire that is included in the other app (for workers within SOS), but this one says ""no current events"" as usual.

So what exactly should you have the app for?",1,17-01-2021,-1
13,JWL74,"Good app, now it should only be made available for the Apple Watch so you can alarm from the watch if you have the LTE model. Would be great.",5,07-02-2020,1
14,carinautter,"Doesn't work no matter what I do in the settings! Never receive any notifications despite, for example, a fire 100 m from where I live. Also, there are NEVER any ""completed events"". That such an important App doesn't work is beyond all criticism, shame on you!",1,13-10-2022,-1
15,Encryptimous,"My app tracked me 71 times in the background in 3 days. Why?
There is no reason why the 112 app should know where I am when it is not in use. The app recommends that it should be able to know location information at all times.

It's nothing but control, knowing where people are, big brother is watching you.

I deleted the app!",1,08-10-2022,-1
16,Missnöjd stamkund!,"I collided with a Moose and of course took the phone and called SOS with this app, as I was out in the middle of the forest I thought it would be good if SOS got my coordinates. But I could easily forget that. SOS didn't get any coordinates and it took at least 30 minutes before they could even figure out where I was, then it took another 40 minutes before the first rescue vehicle arrived. Luckily I was only slightly injured. I don't even dare to think what would have happened if I had had more serious injuries. Scary bad app and scary how they promise that SOS will get my coordinates when they don't.",1,09-10-2020,-1
17,Substans av dignitet,"I have enabled location services for the device in ""settings""-""privacy and security"", but the app does not appear in the list found at ""settings""-""privacy and security""-""location services"" where you can give additional instructions about when the location should be given.

For example, the app ""always open"" is in that list. For that app, I can choose to define ""never"", ""ask next time I share"", ""when using the app"" or ""always"". SOS alarms are not in the same list.

I have restarted the device but that doesn't fix the problem.

I get an error message in the SOS alarm app that ""the app only works correctly if it has access to location"". At that alert, I can press ""change"" and then I am linked to the app's settings, which can be found under ""settings""-""SOS alarm"", but even there there are no setting options related to location. There are only ""Siri and search"" ""notifications"" ""app activities in the background"" and ""mobile data""

I have checked if other apps location services work and they do. I have checked this by, among other things, starting the Badoo app with location services activated and then I get an alert where I am asked if I want to share approximate location or exact location and this in connection with a map that also shows my exact location.

at ""settings""-""privacy and security""-""location services""-""share my location info"" I get a sys modal alert stating ""Share my location info not available. Unable to connect to the server. Try again later”. I have then scrolled down to ""system services"" in the upper menu level ""location services"" and there under ""system services"" I see that ""share my location info"" is activated. The other enabled location services for system services are ""device management"" ""find my IPhone"" ""mobile network search"" ""network and wireless"" ""emergency call and SOS"". Other 12 system services location services are not activated. For example, do not want location-based notices and suggestions, seller identification, iPhone analysis and other privacy violations. However, these deactivated ones do not receive any result regarding finding my location when using maps such as Eniro, SL, Maps.Me, Kartor and Sverigetaxi.

I have unlimited data. I have internet connection.

The phone is set in Lockdown mode. Uses that setting because, among other things, it disables JIT compilation for Javascript. Bugs in the JIT are exploited by 45% of all Malware that attacks devices via a browser. I've only experienced trouble with one app before due to lock down mode and that's the Line app. Then the text message that you need to verify the number is not sent. However, I received that text message when registering in SOS Alarm. Even Instagram's automatic login by recognizing the device after reinstalling the app doesn't work, so you have to enter the password the first time you use that app. Otherwise, I don't experience any problems except that some fonts in browsers that refer to icons become squares, but this only indicates that the web developer is deplorable in that they need frameworks and Google fonts etc. so that they don't have a good grasp of what they really are has under the hood.

Under ""settings"" - ""privacy and security"" analysis and improvements"" all settings are disabled.

I am in Sweden.

ISP Tele2.

I am not connected to an Access Point ie router + switch.

I'm not connected to a VPN. VPN is under settings ""not connected"" and the program that refers to VPN is completely turned off and not started after reboot.

I haven't tested whether the SOS alarm works if you deactivate Lockdown mode because then I get Pegasus right away. A device that is in lockdown mode is probably extra interesting, so now I don't dare turn it off, even though I'm an uninteresting person.

I give one star because there is no information about the app not working in ""Lockdown mode""

A big thistle for Sweden's SOS service, which has not implemented GPS detection for regular phone calls like other countries, so you need an app instead. It is sad that Sweden has fallen so far behind in almost every technological aspect and also in areas that concern our welfare.",1,01-02-2023,-1

You answer to everyone else that ""it disappears when it is no longer relevant"" but do you know anything about human stress and psychology?

Have also received notifications about traffic accidents that have disappeared from the app because, according to you, it is no longer relevant, but just as damned the road is still closed, etc. Really think the history of notices and details should be saved a little longer.

As others have written, you should also be able to enter personal information about your health, which the healthcare staff may need to know in an emergency situation, where it may be a matter of life or death.
There is also no possibility to enter the contact details of a close relative.

Now there is already the possibility to enter personal information about my health and who can be contacted in an emergency situation, in my iPhone. But it would have been an advantage to also be able to have it in this particular app, so the information is easier to find.

Another problem is that my position on the map does not show exactly where I actually am, as usual with automatic positioning from my Iphone (this time it's an Iphone X).

But why do so many complain that it is not possible to verify their mobile number?
It took me about 5 seconds and I did NOT enter +46, but only my mobile number, so that's my tip for successful verification!

And +46 is the CORRECT country code for Sweden, not +47 as everyone has stated here in the reviews!
Maybe that's why the verification fails, if you can't even enter the correct country number?!

Also, remember that a mobile number should be entered like this if the country code is required; +4670xxxxxx.
So the first zero in the number should ALWAYS be removed, even when calling from a landline (if anyone still has it...)",4,15-09-2019,1

337,personen son gillar colorfy,"However, missing a lock or similar on the app so that my little kids don't accidentally call 112 unnecessarily so they sit and play with the phone. Easily happened as ""Call 112"" is a large and easily accessible button, which of course I understand is important given the purpose of the app. But that was the first thing I thought of when I started it😊",5,26-08-2019,1
338,volvotdi,A function where it is possible to call 11414 via the app would have been a great upgrade. Then it will be easier to give the police a good position in cases where you don't want to stop 112,5,26-08-2019,1
