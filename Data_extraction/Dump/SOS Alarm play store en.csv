The GPS notification is extremely verbose and honestly annoying that it's constantly there. The information resources are little bit lacking and should be improved. It would be nice if you by yourself could set the radius that's interesting instead of basing it on the incidents character only. If you live in a very dense area you will get much more notifications, some that are not really relevant for you. If there are reports of issues that have been removed the notification should be shared instead of you opening a notification that leads nowhere. It's a good start but it needs to be refined and innovated.",3,30-08-2019,1.0.1
