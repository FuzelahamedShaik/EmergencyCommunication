Asmaan,"Very good app, but misses better utilization of widgets. I struggle to find apps when I need to charge the car, and have no reason to believe that I will find this app any faster when it comes to life.

A small widget/icon on the lock screen on iOS to open the app would have made this much easier.",4,2022-12-02
Per56,"Latest version of the program crashes on startup. Tried the tricks in the book such as deleting and reinstalling, hard restarting the phone (iPhone SE, iOS 10.3.2) All without effect. Worked without issue before update.

fjellturl√∏per,"Yesterday we had to call for help due to an accident. The accident took place on a mountain trip and we did not know where exactly we were.
We immediately thought of using the Hjelp 113 app because we knew that the app should find our location.
And it turned out to be the best solution.
We received help very quickly from both the fire brigade and an ambulance which arrived at the same time.
Impressive, well-functioning coordination between the Emergency Medicine Communications Center and the Fire Service.",5,2019-06-09

Arloutleier,"This app should be used by everyone have. Often it can take minutes to save lives. It is then important to call for help quickly and to the right place.

Gusk1,"Dear SNLA. Could you please stop confusing the Norwegian people.
110 and 113 are not and will not become emergency numbers.
The emergency number is only 1-1-2, which is the same as in the rest of Europe.
This is extremely important for people to understand if there is only an emergency number on the phone, or you have to use a phone that you do not know the code for.
I expect that this is based on a misunderstanding of terms and that you will get this corrected immediately.",1,2018-12-19
me to be 13,"First of all, I have to admit that the setup in the app is fantastic. I really like that you can choose between fire and ambulance service. On the other hand, I miss the police hotkey.
After registration 1 year ago, the app has not been used, when an emergency situation arose the app required login/registration again, which meant that the app was not used in the critical situation.

IRRITERT x10!,"Downloaded the app now, didn't understand the rationale that the app HAD to have access to my contacts! it was too poorly explained, it doesn't get access to my contacts, can't understand at all that it should be necessary.. Should the emergency center call a RANDOM contact in my list with my location in an emergency..? sounds absolutely absurd.. why does the app need my contacts to find out where I AM? and why do you want permission to
to ALWAYS know where I am, it is necessary that you ONLY know when the app is used... That is when it is needed.. ! Although I don't understand the reasoning for this either..
I deleted the App, too bad an explanation..",1,2018-02-23
Ronnylso,"Good idea with such an App, but it could perhaps be even better. Ex:
1) button called ""Send coordinates"" which sends the coordinates of where you are automatically via SMS so that you don't risk reading it out incorrectly.

I could imagine that all the numbers were shown at the same time and stood still. If you are stressed, the numbers can quickly become jittery when they ""run"" across the screen.
Tip: You can change the phone number in 'Settings' on the iPhone. Then you can e.g. enter 112 if you are in Spain for 2 weeks, or 17 if you are in France. If you want to test the function without calling 113 unnecessarily, you can enter your house phone number, e.g.",5,2010-04-07

Trudern,"I don't see the problem with the app being too easy to come across. To actually call, you must first press the app, then press call 1-1-3, then answer if you really want to call. So 3 presses before calling 113.

On a first aid course a year ago, we were recommended the app. There it was said that when you called via the app, the switchboard automatically got the position on its screen, isn't this correct, since it says that you can give the coordinates from the app?

Unfortunately, I had to use this app myself, but then it was good to have. Wasn't asked for location, but gave an approximate address, so then I thought they saw my location since I called via the app.",5,2013-10-05

Polarnorth1,"Liked the latest version with address capability. Missing the possibility to lock coordinates when you have to go far to get mobile coverage, but that is probably solved by calling anyway because the coordinates are saved together with the 113 name, if there is no overwriting on the next call attempt.
