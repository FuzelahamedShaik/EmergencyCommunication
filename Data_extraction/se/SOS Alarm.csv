The phone is set in Lockdown mode. Uses that setting because, among other things, it disables JIT compilation for Javascript. Bugs in the JIT are exploited by 45% of all Malware that attacks devices via a browser. I've only experienced trouble with one app before due to lock down mode and that's the Line app. Then the text message that you need to verify the number is not sent. However, I received that text message when registering in SOS Alarm. Even Instagram's automatic login by recognizing the device after reinstalling the app doesn't work, so you have to enter the password the first time you use that app. Otherwise, I don't experience any problems except that some fonts in browsers that refer to icons become squares, but this only indicates that the web developer is deplorable in that they need frameworks and Google fonts etc. so that they don't have a good grasp of what they really are has under the hood.

Under ""settings"" - ""privacy and security"" analysis and improvements"" all settings are disabled.

I am in Sweden.

ISP Tele2.

I am not connected to an Access Point ie router + switch.

I'm not connected to a VPN. VPN is under settings ""not connected"" and the program that refers to VPN is completely turned off and not started after reboot.

I haven't tested whether the SOS alarm works if you deactivate Lockdown mode because then I get Pegasus right away. A device that is in lockdown mode is probably extra interesting, so now I don't dare turn it off, even though I'm an uninteresting person.

I give one star because there is no information about the app not working in ""Lockdown mode""

,Tarlet,"Perfect app for all imaginable necessary extremely urgent situations, when you need to be able to quickly alert the right authority.

As others have written, you should also be able to enter personal information about your health, which the healthcare staff may need to know in an emergency situation, where it may be a matter of life or death.
There is also no possibility to enter the contact details of a close relative.

Now there is already the possibility to enter personal information about my health and who can be contacted in an emergency situation, in my iPhone. But it would have been an advantage to also be able to have it in this particular app, so the information is easier to find.

Another problem is that my position on the map does not show exactly where I actually am, as usual with automatic positioning from my Iphone (this time it's an Iphone X).

But why do so many complain that it is not possible to verify their mobile number?
It took me about 5 seconds and I did NOT enter +46, but only my mobile number, so that's my tip for successful verification!

And +46 is the CORRECT country code for Sweden, not +47 as everyone has stated here in the reviews!
Maybe that's why the verification fails, if you can't even enter the correct country number?!

Also, remember that a mobile number should be entered like this if the country code is required; +4670xxxxxx.
So the first zero in the number should ALWAYS be removed, even when calling from a landline (if anyone still has it...)",4,2019-09-15,

That is, if you have chosen to share your location all the time, you are not only visible when you use the app yourself in the event of an accident, but you can also be found if you yourself disappear due to an accident/crime where SOS can track you after a police report has been made.

Now the position may already be shared regardless, but if you want to be able to be tracked even though you don't report an accident, for example, but have been hit yourself, then you have to agree to it, right?
