We immediately thought of using the Hjelp 113 app because we knew that the app should find our location.

We received help very quickly from both the fire brigade and an ambulance which arrived at the same time.

110 and 113 are not and will not become emergency numbers.
The emergency number is only 1-1-2, which is the same as in the rest of Europe.
This is extremely important for people to understand if there is only an emergency number on the phone, or you have to use a phone that you do not know the code for.
