Why are there no emergency numbers and opening hours for the nearest health center?

Why is there no health advice number and opening hours - because the matter has often been solved that way and it hasn't even been necessary to go to the doctor's office to guess.

115,,MasterMarko,"The use of positioning should have its own settings and not just be on all the time by default. Positioning is inaccurate indoors. For example, this is why entering your home address into the application would be important, why isn't that feature there? As an example, for example, an elderly person who has an accident or a seizure in his own home, or if he does not have time to tell his address due to a sudden threat encountered at home (domestic violence, disturbing the peace at home...). This would be very simple to solve, developers. In its current form, the application is almost useless. How much did the Estonian developers bill the government for this too?",2,2016-03-18,,-1

123,,hoe666,"Softa seems good and certainly does what it says. It's nice to think that he gets information about the location if he doesn't know it himself or can tell... Then it's mandatory but...

Softa hangs a bit unnecessarily actively on the GPS and this consumes the battery. You can't choose from the settings to update the location at a specified time interval or only when the program is open... Now it feels like the program updates the location all the time... As if the battery capacity is too much

Because of this, I mostly think of deleting the software because if you are on a trip, it would be nice to be able to call the emergency center there and not see when the software has sucked the battery dry...

In addition, I was thinking that the software could not send the location to the emergency center by text message and not by data connection? The information would be delivered more reliably... So this is when you call there... Not just to be sure...

So development is still required before this can be called good... The idea is great.",1,2015-10-06,,1

The application wants to use the location even when it is not in the foreground. Why? And promise to tell the reason in English when asking about this. Why? Of course, almost everyone knows the language this well, but it is nevertheless an application intended for very local use.
