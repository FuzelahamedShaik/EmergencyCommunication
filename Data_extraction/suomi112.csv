JJ_84,"It was fine to call through the program, but the positioning does not work as it should. Gave wrong location information.",3,2016-01-18,,
Yulmur,"Really, this location should be on all the time to work during an emergency call. However, this consumes the battery considerably, so it should not be kept on. In the moment of emergency, in a state of shock, the positioning did not work for this reason, and on top of that, I advised the fire department in the wrong direction. Fortunately, passers-by quickly corrected the situation and we got the right direction to the emergency center.

I wish the positioning would work when using the application.",3,2019-05-26,,
Olli 12345,"A clear and well-functioning application! Thank you !

NOTE EVERYONE: Despite the wording of the settings, positioning is NOT on all the time! Only the always selection is so that the positioning would work when an emergency call is in progress!",5,2016-02-16,,
samikki,"The call is successful through the application. The location has not been tested as such an emergency has not occurred yet.

For those who want a ""not in the background"" option for location, have you realized that during an emergency call, the application moves to the background when the phone application becomes active? Then even positioning wouldn't work if it was prohibited in the background.

The battery consumption caused by the application can be monitored under ""Battery"" in the settings. From there you can clearly see that this application does not consume the battery. If you have tested the program, you will naturally see a small amount of use there. Under normal circumstances, an unused application does not consume the battery at all.",4,2016-04-11,,
Keksimonsteri,"For some reason, the push notification notification cannot be found anywhere in the application, and it does not open when the notification is tapped. Wouldn't it be good to have them readable somewhere, if it is swept away from the notification center?

In addition, the order of the announcements on the announcements tab is somehow random, and you can't rearrange them. Wouldn't it be nice to have the latest ones at the top right away?",3,2021-01-26,,
Henkka V.,"iOS 12 and later versions support sending location information during an emergency call anyway, so the only significant additional benefit of this app is receiving local emergency notifications. For that, however, the application requires unrestricted access to the GPS location, which it also uses diligently (at the expense of the battery). More harm than good, in my opinion.",2,2020-01-29,,
Virittäjä,"Location is of course a great thing and in many cases it helps a lot, but the application could also have the user's basic information.

Locating to an apartment building with a business connection does not yet lead to/bring the emergency services there.

Harmin paikka,I wondered for a couple of days why the iPhone 7's battery is dwindling at a tremendous rate. Then I checked the situation in the battery settings and I was surprised: the 112 application has been running in the background for more than 20 hours during the day and has consumed 65% of the battery's energy.

Kivakaveri,"Despite previous evaluations, the application does consume battery in the background. This obviously depends on how much you move during the day. On some days, there has been 40 min of background activity. and then sometimes only 2 min. Could it be because of those ""local notices"" that you have to apply for them again in each location? The consumption is still not massive, but there are apps with similar features that don't use the battery that much.",3,2019-04-27,,

Tzar5846,"Battery consumption has gotten out of control with the version update. The app, which used to spend a quiet life, now consumes 50% of the iPhone 7's battery during 8 hours of the night. You can also check this in Settings: 112 Finland, Background location",2,2019-10-13,,
Simo J.,"In version 2.0.4 background activity and with this the battery usage has gone wild according to the battery usage view of the phone settings. And the application's settings still cannot prohibit the use of background tracking for official announcements, so the application cannot be used to locate emergency calls only in the background of the call.

In addition, danger information experiments have not been received even once, so doubts arise about their operation in real situations.

When asking for location permission, the explanation is incomplete, because location during calls is not mentioned. This should be the most important function of the application, so there is a risk that users will not pay attention to this and will only allow positioning when using the application.",2,2019-10-12,,

I myself have (unfortunately) had to use this in the event of a work accident and this application pinpointed the location very accurately.

Zoppaz,"NOTE EVERYONE: it really eats battery and a lot. I was surprised when the battery wears out so quickly and I thought that the phone is just getting so old that the battery has worn out. But then I remembered that I installed this program. After removal, the battery consumption is unchanged again. For some reason that battery consumption doesn't show up in the weapons section.

NOTE EVERYONE: Contrary to what is falsely claimed in the comments here, location information is REALLY being sent continuously even if you don't use the app! That's the only way regional hazard notices can work.

In addition, when making a normal emergency call without an app, the phones automatically send location information to the emergency center using AML, so this App is no longer needed to share the location.

The only benefit of this app is danger notifications, but even for that there is a built-in function maintained by Apple in Apple devices, if the Alarm Center would only realize to use it, and not waste money on maintaining this, at best, mediocre App.

You can't choose from the settings to update the location at a specified time interval or only when the program is open... Now it feels like the program updates the location all the time...

Because of this, I mostly think of deleting the software because if you are on a trip, it would be nice to be able to call the emergency center there and not see when the software has sucked the battery dry...

In addition, I was thinking that the software could not send the location to the emergency center by text message and not by data connection? The information would be delivered more reliably... So this is when you call there... Not just to be sure...

It is potentially dangerous if the user has to enter their number in an emergency. In addition, more attention could be paid to usability. The call button could look more like a button (communicate to the user that this can be pressed), and it could have, for example, a green handset icon.

Googlen käyttäjä,"Totally useless app. In fact, it only slows down calling 911. Who the hell is coding these? Once again, a great application has been ordered from Digia and I'm sure the money has been burned admirably. 1. Why in v*** does the application alone take up 36.2 MB of space, and other data after installation already takes up 7 megabytes? And if you try to transfer the application to the memory card, then the size of the application will already increase to closer to 70 megabytes 2. Why does the application need permission, e.g. phone contacts, photos, videos and other files, or monitoring network connections, not to mention access to the memory card? 3. The number query that opens when the application starts cannot save a number. 4. Who has location services eating up the battery on the 247? and Battery usage: High.. Apparently, the application polls its location somewhere inside the for loop a thousand times per second and drains the battery in an instant. 5. When opening, an advertisement box opens, which you have to wait for to close 6. The application does not even have its own Dialer. There is too little space in the review to write down all the problems... completely a wolf.. but what else can you expect from Digia..",1,18-06-2015,8fc92200-14fb-4dd5-9811-297c5249175f,1.0.119
