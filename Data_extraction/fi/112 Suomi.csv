The new version asks for location data permission all the time (or after the Android update, Android is smarter and monitors applications) -> incomprehensible that I should send location data to the app maker all the time -> it's ok to send it when I call 112. I have to delete it because I don't want to receive that query a few minutes",1,2023-01-26 14:47:17,4.4.12

If so, it should be ensured that the location information is not removed from the device during normal use (an emergency call is not normal use).

Both times the emergency center got the exact location where I was. The first time I used it, I was surprised how many settings had to be accepted in order to be able to make a call (location acceptance, entering my own phone number, and thirdly, you have to accept that the application can proceed to make the call).

It would be good for these to have their own vibration style settings and be separate from the danger notices. Now I had to remove the vibration from the phone side as well, but it wasn't enough under ""Authority notices"", I also had to remove ""rn-push-notification-channel""? Pretty confusing.

,Asiantuntija,"The number of false calls can increase if small children get their hands on a cell phone and accidentally open the application and call. So some confirmation would be good. Now I don't want to test the application, lest I call the emergency center.

A slider for enabling location data would also be handy.

It's also good that other ""emergency numbers"" can be found in the application.",2,2015-06-19,
,oneiceman,It makes no sense to require the use of positioning constantly. Unusable as such when it eats up the battery far too quickly. It could be good if positioning is enabled only when using the application.,1,2015-06-19,
,Miihkali,"Quite large software considering its functions. The location update that is constantly running in the background consumes the battery unnecessarily. The user interface and usability are completely contrary to the iOS world (only the mouse pointer is missing). The idea in the software is good, but it requires better planning and implementation.",1,2015-06-19,
