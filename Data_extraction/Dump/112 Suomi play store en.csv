aa34cb13-8606-4d9e-b63f-f6b18fa81872,Eki Tee,"With the older version, when you called 112 normally (without starting this application), the cage received location information from somewhere (maybe this application sent it in the background). The new version asks for location data permission all the time (or after the Android update, Android is smarter and monitors applications) -> incomprehensible that I should send location data to the app maker all the time -> it's ok to send it when I call 112. I have to delete it because I don't want to receive that query a few minutes",1,26-01-2023,4.4.12

I have granted permission while using the app but I don't want it to be tracking location on background. Now I get constant location requests and whats even Worse I can not use the app unless i grant the permission because when i open the app request popup keeps popping over and over even if i press cancel thus making the app impossible to use.,2,24-01-2023,4.4.11

If so, it should be ensured that the location information is not removed from the device during normal use (an emergency call is not normal use).

Both times the emergency center got the exact location where I was.

Either force closing it or ""backing"" out of seems to make the saving fail for whatever reason. It would be nice if you'd display a warning that it won't suspend and keep using the GPS location until the battery dies, unless it is swipe killed. I understand that you don't want it to be suspended before the location is sent, but you could at least provide a clear way to kill the application. It would also eliminate my first problem. I would personally never have noticed that my phone number wasn't saved and found a ""work around"" if it hadn't killed my battery. Not something you want to fiddle with in case of an emergency. Finally, 42 MB... why? So you didn't have to touch Java? I suppose all versions run on QT and they don't need to be certified individually, but judging from the quality the certification process can't be very thorough. The mobile applications seem really simple so I can't justify the size and load time/splash screen compared, well, native applications of acceptable quality.

The phone number is asked again every time (obvious bug), the installation package has a size of 12 megabytes, which significantly raises the threshold to download this over 2G, for example, at a cottage (this cannot be explained by anything other than the fixation to shove that Qt everywhere, even with the threat that the size of the software approx. 20-fold) and for some strange reason, a splash screen is forcibly displayed every time at startup, which probably warms the mind at the point when you have managed to cut your leg and bleed to death. I don't care at all if this kind of garbage is sold to private customers for millions, but at the point when such a critical public service, the failure of which is paid for at worst in human lives, is implemented in such a totally unprofessional manner, it starts to bother me, to put it mildly.
