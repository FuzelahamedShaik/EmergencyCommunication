0,deangadams,"Love this app and especially the addition of W3W. Would be awesome to have this as a widget to always show your location and also watch integration so you can have a complication on the Home Screen showing what three words locations for people hiking, exercising etc. easy way to get the information when youâ€™re already on the phone is to raise your wrist.",4,08-11-2020,1
1,STEltham,"I recently loaded this app onto the shortcut screen of our family phones (mainly for the kids) with the expectation that I would never end up using it. 
This weekend, we had a fire in our garage where my husband was trapped and our garage door bolted closed, our home phone was out due to no power (thanks NBN) and I was trying to get my husband free. I called for the kids to evacuated and call emergency, with their shock they couldnâ€™t find their phone so I grabbed mine.  Using this app took the frustration out of trying to find and open the phone app, get onto the call screen and dial emergency services. All I had to do was click the app, hit call then confirm -
It was extremely responsive and I managed this one handed while trying to move furniture and unbolt a door.
Fortunately all worked out well, emergency services arrived and everyone was safe. 
A brilliant app.",5,04-06-2019,-1
2,Andy Tibicen,I have used and promoted this since its inception as emergency +. I brought F&R NSW and Microsoft Australia together to port the application to the Windows phone store. I always thought the app could store GPS coordinates so if really remote you could take them to a location with coverage to give the exact to 000. It seems it does not but it should. At present I would need to take a photo and then get the coordinates from the EXIF metadata. A long way around and only IT nerds would think to do this. Can we please have a capability to store gps so we can then relay to 000 once back in service. Thank you.,5,18-09-2021,1
3,Bigdog1971,"On last Friday night I suffered a crashing stroke. I was out on the bathroom tiles and couldn't talk, thankfully my wife was right there. She was a little flustered (understandable) and could not remember the number to call. She had this app on her phone and switch straight to the app and called the emergency number directly, also read the home address straight from the app screen.
I apologize if my words are mixed up, but I'm still recovering from the stroke.
I owe my wife for her recognition of what was happening and straight through to the help needed.",5,12-09-2017,1
4,[ The Captain ],"I had a serious fall mountain biking a couple of days ago. I managed to walk to the nearest fire road in a conservation area and gave my coordinates to the 000 operator. Our excellent ambo service had a 4WD in the park in good time, but took another hour and a half trying to track down which fire road I was on. I was in contact by phone but our maps were different. Eventually other riders spread out to guide them in.
Would have been much better if they had something to plug my coordinates in and guide them to me on an up to date map.",3,11-06-2020,1
5,Stampman2001,"* Valuable app which works well. 

* No clear channel provided to give feedback to app developer team - 000 website â€˜contact us for feedbackâ€™ page sends you off to a myriad of pages on Department of Home Affairs website :(

* Feedback on behalf of a visually impaired member of community: the location details may not be very easy for some people to see.

* Perhaps a future release possibly include an accessibility option whereby the user could press a button for the location details to be read out by the phone? [Google maps is able to read out directions even when the phone is on a call, so such a feature may be possible(?).]",5,05-04-2018,-1
6,.......................123,Used this app in a remote National park in outback Qld when a group member collapsed. We got straight through and weâ€™re able to clearly communicate our location in the park (not near any of the camp grounds or roads etc) to the paramedics. We had no coverage and the sat phone wouldnâ€™t work but this app connected! Everyone who journeys in remote Oz should have this app.,5,01-08-2021,1
7,GI Judy,Caution when reading out what 3 words over a phone to emergency services: their word list has similar sounding and pluralized words that may be misread by the operator and there are many examples of positions several km away with similar sounding names. There is security research on this topic. I would suggest incorporating other open source position readout protocols with better core technology.,4,09-07-2022,1
8,d-tjarlz,"I would like to see functionality for this app to send location coordinates as an SMS to a programmed list of contacts. This button should share space with the others on the main screen.

9,Shaza70,"I had to use the app recently with the bush fire crisis I live in a no mobile service area and land line was damaged due to the fires.  My husbands phone does not have mobile wifi so canâ€™t use it to dial 000, and only works while the internet is up.  So downloaded the app thinking he can use it to dial 000 and found he couldnâ€™t the app told him to use his phone to dial 112 and that didnâ€™t work either - saying not available in the area. So he had to use Facebook messenger to phone me to ask me to call 000 I was 30km away. Donâ€™t waste your time",1,14-01-2020,-1
10,thecarefulcactus,"The app was so helpful.
It gives a perfect location every time.
The app has heaps of great features but, the app looks a bit tacky and there are buttons that I donâ€™t know what they do.

11,Hatty_the_chickstar,"This app is wonderful and surely has saved some lives.

12,Graman62,I wish the app could give an on water lat/long we are having to convert the location given from this app to what we can use. Just the option to select the form would help. Otherwise itâ€™s a good app,5,03-01-2022,1
13,ThaaBaar,The what3words integration is genius and is exactly what Iâ€™ve wanted when sometimes the apps location description is occasionally off or too vague. It will also absolutely be vital for those lost in bush land who make calls. An absolutely must have!!,5,06-11-2020,-1
14,Phillip fr Aus,"Concept and execution is great.  However, I think it could be improved by adding the WhatThreeWords location in addition to the GPS coordinates.  In stressful situations, quoting three short words is often easier to articulate than a string of numbers.",5,02-11-2019,1

Would be excellent to have automatic dial and loudspeaker function with one touch from a locked phone. I understand risks with accidentally dial but itâ€™s too hard for a 3 year old in current format?

Maybe where it asks â€œcancelâ€ you can colour this red and â€œcall 000â€ make this green! Remember kids can read it needs to be picture or colour based for them.

107,Gregory Opera,"As a former emergency responder, I think â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display oneâ€™s exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.

The application does need a fair bit of work however.

Firstly, there is â€œcriticalâ€ information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even thereâ€¦ For example, to find the â€˜CPR guidesâ€™ and â€˜fire alertsâ€™, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking â€˜More Informationâ€™ and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either â€˜Royal Life Savingâ€™ or â€˜Fire Alertsâ€™.

This is way too many steps to access â€œcriticalâ€ information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldnâ€™t even realise that they could find â€œcriticalâ€ information like this deep in the menu.

It would also be nice to see â€˜Apple Watchâ€™ support integrated.

Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to oneâ€™s Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.

I also donâ€™t understand why there is no support for â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ whatsoever.

I rarely know when â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ have been issued, because I donâ€™t listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I donâ€™t use social media, so the only time I know thereâ€™s an â€˜Amber Alertâ€™ active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)â€¦ If this application supported â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ or better yet, supported â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ AND â€˜Apple Watchâ€™ products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an â€˜Amber Alertâ€™ is active.

Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etcâ€¦) to anybody in the affected areaâ€¦ As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.

â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ is an invaluable application to install on oneâ€™s smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (â€œdraftâ€) applicationâ€¦ Whilst Iâ€™m sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms.",2,22-03-2022,1

109,Ava0Q,"Just downloaded app & love that it has a street address shown on a map AND lat/long displayed PLUS degree of accuracy (within 65m for example). While 000 may ask for cross streets, these can be seen on the map in built up areas. And having lat/long is better than nothing in remote or rural areas, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe we need to upgrade our 000 responders so they have the ability to view lat/long on a map or vehicle GPS. Given the huge areas that don't have street addresses, lat/long is necessary at times.",5,08-02-2017,1
110,Maggiemg22,"I was showing my mother this app saying how it was a great idea. She thought so too but her feedback was that the coordinates were very small and difficult to read, especially if you were in an emergency situation and feeling dizzy etc. It looks like there is room to make the co-ordinates larger and perhaps black on white text would be easier to read especially for older people or if you're glasses have been lost/broken in an accident. Thanks :)",4,20-01-2016,1
111,Cameron Hamill,"If the app could automatically share the app users GPS location with Emergency Services i.e. without the app users intervention, it would be 5 stars from me.

112,Denyer's One,I had to call an ambulance for a life threatening emergency today. I was on an unfamiliar rural road and had so much trouble trying to explain my location. The guy almost died while the ambulance was delayed... I'm totally overjoyed to find this app as I can already see how essential it is... Should be compulsory for every motorist! Truly a great invention which will save lives!,5,27-11-2014,1
113,Ceewil,"The app info section says it was developed with valuable assistance of Vision Australia. Why then is the font so small and the GPS coordinates and address details so small?! In a stressful emergency, this info needs to be bigger. A previous review suggestion for the inclusion of the poison line and mental health emergency number numbers is a good idea. Overall though this app is a good. Having had to call 000 before on a remote road with no reference points, this app would have been very useful .",3,10-03-2014,1
114,R-Buddy,This app seemed like a great idea - very clear layout with easy to read GPS co-ordinates.  Was about to load the app onto my mountain biking son's phone and noticed the current location was way off.  Clicked on the map and noticed a disclaimer - 'accurate to 6000m' which makes the usefulness of the app questionable especially situations such as mountain biking reserves or national parks etc.  6km is quite a distance. Can't understand this inaccuracy - hopefully it can be fixed.,3,17-10-2015,1

116,**alc**,Great idea but GPS location coordinates on the home page are too small to read. Unless you have 20/20 vision it is too hard to see the location and numbers.

117,Jadzla,"If cross street, other emergency numbers like poisons, mental health and a spot for making notes of when u called were added then this would be 100% useful.

Like gps-coordinates.net the App needs to convert into an address and give nearest cross street or intersection! E.g. Display ""Great Eastern Highway, 300m North of Evans Street"" or ""Willy Rd, 200m South of High St"".  Most people attending an emergency aren't near home and haven't any idea of where or what the name of the nearest cross street is.  I know cause I had the same issue in the Blue Mountains once.

The phone numbers listed are also not in the recognised standard format, as per the ACMA Telco Numbering guidelines, which causes confusion. Ie: â€˜13-2500â€™ is listed when it should be â€˜132 500â€™. 

Lastly, GPS locations are not necessarily accurate as it uses A-GPS when inside (not GPS), which places me several hundred metres (and in the wrong address) to where I am actually located. Further, coords are presented in decimal degrees only. This is not compatible with all emergency service CAD systems, and should also be presented in decimal minutes and also UTM.
