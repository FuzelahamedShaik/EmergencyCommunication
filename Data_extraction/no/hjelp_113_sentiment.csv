110 and 113 are not and will not become emergency numbers.

,DocPilegrimus,"Finally a useful function that allows you to tell where you are at the same time as you call the alarm center:-) It is the position that is important and correct. The address that appears is ""approximate"" and not that important.",5,2014-04-16,<4.0.0,1
,Trudern,"I don't see the problem with the app being too easy to come across. To actually call, you must first press the app, then press call 1-1-3, then answer if you really want to call. So 3 presses before calling 113.

On a first aid course a year ago, we were recommended the app. There it was said that when you called via the app, the switchboard automatically got the position on its screen, isn't this correct, since it says that you can give the coordinates from the app?

Unfortunately, I had to use this app myself, but then it was good to have. Wasn't asked for location, but gave an approximate address, so then I thought they saw my location since I called via the app.",5,2013-10-05,<4.0.0,1

Should be updated with new street maps. It is only about 3-4 years since the street changed its name...",3,2013-09-14,<4.0.0,-1
,Sommerfugl72,"Wrong address as the map is out of date and we live in a new (4 years old) housing estate.
The air ambulance probably goes by the coordinates, so maybe it would have found me anyway.. If they are right then :-)",2,2013-06-20,<4.0.0,-1
,Eiandri,Fantastic app. Haven't had any problem with GPS and finds my position with great accuracy (haven't tried it on the mountain yet). Something that bothers me is that it is all too easy to come across the 113 button.,4,2013-06-07,<4.0.0,1

,Barentz,"Definitely a nice app, but I miss a reason for giving access to address book. Why? An address book is private and I don't understand the need to give such access. See others have asked the same thing. Developer should give an answer.",3,2013-06-14,<4.0.0,1

,ThomasEll,"1) Often takes a long time to retrieve position
2) Often inaccurate position (But if I use the TomTom app, for example, it finds me immediately) GPS works perfectly fine
3) Slightly clumsy interface. Very easy to press 113 in the event of a mistake (no child lock). Graphics are outdated

I really like the idea, but this could be done better.",2,2013-06-06,<4.0.0,1
,"Jar, B√¶rum","I am told that it has an accuracy of 5008 meters at the cabin!

When checking the chart reference, it shows that we are at sea despite being safely on land.

Over 5 km error (as the crow flies) is a scary error, and dangerous to use if you're in a hurry!",1,2013-05-09,<4.0.0,-1
,ludvigvan,"It's possible that it's good to have when you're on a trip in the woods and fields, BUT IT CAN'T GIVE THE CORRECT HOME ADDRESS AS WELL AS IT BOASTS AN ACCURACY OF 30 METERS!!!!!",1,2013-03-14,<4.0.0,1
,Polarnorth1,"Liked the latest version with address capability. Missing the possibility to lock coordinates when you have to go far to get mobile coverage, but that is probably solved by calling anyway because the coordinates are saved together with the 113 name, if there is no overwriting on the next call attempt. I have many other apps for GPS use, especially Motion-X is good, but in terms of speed, app 113 is now the best. Larger font on the coordinate would have been great.",4,2011-07-24,<4.0.0,1

,SwooooP,"The weakness of this app is that hopefully you never get to use it. In other words, the app will be forgotten, and the day the accident happens you will be so stressed that you will dial 113 manually. So basically the app is useless.",4,2010-05-01,<4.0.0,-1
,Tromzz,"Ended up in the event that I got a use for it. When I was first in connection with amk, the app is closed and you are usually quite stressed when you call them. It was much easier to verbally explain approximately where you were than to start messing around on the phone when you had far more important things to do. If they could make this more suitable for emergencies I would have used it again. I only feel that I am left with NOK 17 for a good cause and a shortcut to 113 on the phone.",1,2011-02-24,<4.0.0,1
,Rustto,"This worked well before, but after switching to iOS4 it no longer works. It can't find your location anymore. It's a shame, because the idea behind the app is great.",2,2010-10-31,<4.0.0,1
,LarsMartin,"17 kroner for an app you won't use more than maybe once is, in this case, absolutely great! These four can be the difference between life and death! And should you forget to use the app in a hurry, it can still be used during a normal call. :)",5,2010-10-18,<4.0.0,1
