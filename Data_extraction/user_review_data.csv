Shakes First,"The latitude and longitude are correct, I did notice the address is 1800 metres off. While I hope I never need to use the app, having doubts of its veracity in an emergency situation would cause more harm than any help. A way to calibrate it to a location you know, like your home, would be a good idea.",2,01-02-2023,a7dc8b64-3c92-4026-848a-386d47a782da,2.34

Gary Brown,"Rendering assistance to a lone dehydrated aged sailor at water's edge reporting as a ""concern for welfare"". Frustratingly with no road and no x-street to pass to 000 it was simple as saying Alpha, Bravo, Charlie where GPS and three words was spot on in guiding the ambulance close. ""if we can't find you we can't rescue you"", and day or night not all calls for assistance come with an observable street address or for that matter even on ""Land"", that's within a three metre square.

Gary Pitts,"Dangerous app. It thinks I am at my old address, some 50km from where I actually am. GPS won't update. Waze picks up my location correctly so it isn't a GPS or phone issue.

It would be safer not to have the app and use street signs or landmarks or GPS coordinates from your phone to report your location.",1,16-09-2022,61ac2943-cede-433a-8e8b-f1aa0f4f7706,2.34
Steve C,Great 'just in case' app. Truncation of 'what three words' in primary and map screen may be problematic (unless font size significantly reduced impacting vision impaired individuals). When tapping info box from map screen all text increases in size and often pushes last of the 'three words' out of view/access. Better highlighting of additional services accessible through the menu may also assist those who haven't explored app prior to their emergency/crisis.,4,13-09-2022,71196640-467b-4cc7-80c4-40463099e32a,2.34

C I Bennett,"This is an app everybody should have on their phone. For the average, untrained person, it can be extremely difficult to think rationally in an extreme emergency due to adrenaline coursing through your system that often leads to panic.

Benjamin Quilliam,"Good start. You need to add a share button to copy the what3words location, or to automatically share with a person ( via messenger or WhatsApp for example) or even share directly to emergency services.

On the following screen, the address, co-ordinates and the 3 words are visible as they should be. The location on the map is not shown, because it is not centered, and is out of bounds of the frame. The 3 word system is smart, however, as I hold the phone, the words are changing constantly. This could lead to misunderstanding with the operator. Australia is a developed and wealthy country. It should adopt a system where the location of the phone is sent out on a touch of a button.

Gordon CAMPBELL,"Neil's comment (20th April 2020) is 100% correct. I have the app and give it 5 stars... but... a newer app does so MUCH MORE!!! Check out 'What3Words'. It has so many more uses and is used by millions of people since it was launched in 2013. ie; Locating friends in crowds at a football match or rock concert (not much use right now but will be when COV-19 is under control), quickly finding a business in large industrial complexes; finding a friend's camping spot off the beaten track. Sure, you can use GPS co-ordinates, but three words are so much easier to enter and remember than a string of numbers.Try it.",5,30-05-2020,e63c4ee5-2db9-4d38-96a1-a215070efdc0,1.26

A Google user,"PUBLIC AND FRNSW PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS.Whoever is in responsible for public awareness of this app SHOULD BE SACKED. Less than 2 days ago there was a father and daughter lost in deep snow near Thredbo. This opportunity, and many others in the past, must be seized upon and the media used to educate and reinforce the need for all persons to have this app on their phone and to know how to use it.  I have used app before, as a Police Radio Dispatcher.  5 teenage girls were lost in bushland in winter at night. Police had been searching for them for some time but the girls didn't know where they were and a triangulation from there phone only showed a rough area. The supervisor was about to call in a helicopter to assist in the search. I called back the young girl's phone and asked if she had the Emergency+ app on her phone. She didn't but she did have internet connection so I was able to talk her through the download. Within minutes  I had her location PINPOINTED through the lat/long coordinates. Using mapping we were able to walk the girls to a close by track whilst coordinating Police to walk in from the nearest road.  This is just one of many stories about this app. IT SAVES LIVES!!",5,13-08-2019,16694c6c-d3b6-4250-b724-a5338f825dff,1.16

A Google user,"Good concept. Would be good if you could quickly share your location via one of your installed messaging apps e.g. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS rather than having to read these small numbers out with a chance of error I would assume. You could then send the coordinates to a friend and you could even have pre-written messages with low, medium, urgent and life threatening levels telling them to pass it onto another authority. Basically you could get that message to someone in seconds rather than making an error prone phone call. Also messaging can sometimes get through where phone calls will not. It should also send your phone number in the message so you can be reached.",4,16-12-2017,092adf52-144d-4ac5-8a0b-2d5592a94187,1.16

Would be nice if there were a way to test it without an actual emergency happening but probably not really feasible.

A Google user,Though there are a few major flaws. There is no user prompt to turn on Location Services (GPS/WiFi) meaning you will end up with an accuracy of ~2km instead of <20m. You also have to force close the app in order to end it as it will keep GPS on if you don't.,2,05-12-2013,096a03e6-e268-4290-b8d9-e899a0fb23aa,1

STEltham,"I recently loaded this app onto the shortcut screen of our family phones (mainly for the kids) with the expectation that I would never end up using it. 
This weekend, we had a fire in our garage where my husband was trapped and our garage door bolted closed, our home phone was out due to no power (thanks NBN) and I was trying to get my husband free. I called for the kids to evacuated and call emergency, with their shock they couldn’t find their phone so I grabbed mine.  Using this app took the frustration out of trying to find and open the phone app, get onto the call screen and dial emergency services. All I had to do was click the app, hit call then confirm -
It was extremely responsive and I managed this one handed while trying to move furniture and unbolt a door.
Fortunately all worked out well, emergency services arrived and everyone was safe. 
A brilliant app.",5,04-06-2019,,
Andy Tibicen,I have used and promoted this since its inception as emergency +. I brought F&R NSW and Microsoft Australia together to port the application to the Windows phone store. I always thought the app could store GPS coordinates so if really remote you could take them to a location with coverage to give the exact to 000. It seems it does not but it should. At present I would need to take a photo and then get the coordinates from the EXIF metadata. A long way around and only IT nerds would think to do this. Can we please have a capability to store gps so we can then relay to 000 once back in service. Thank you.,5,18-09-2021,,

Gregory Opera,"As a former emergency responder, I think ‘Emergency Plus’ is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display one’s exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.

The application does need a fair bit of work however.

Firstly, there is “critical” information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even there… For example, to find the ‘CPR guides’ and ‘fire alerts’, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking ‘More Information’ and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either ‘Royal Life Saving’ or ‘Fire Alerts’.

This is way too many steps to access “critical” information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldn’t even realise that they could find “critical” information like this deep in the menu.

It would also be nice to see ‘Apple Watch’ support integrated.

Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use ‘Emergency Plus’ independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to one’s Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.

I also don’t understand why there is no support for ‘Amber Alerts’ whatsoever.

I rarely know when ‘Amber Alerts’ have been issued, because I don’t listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I don’t use social media, so the only time I know there’s an ‘Amber Alert’ active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)… If this application supported ‘Amber Alerts’ or better yet, supported ‘Amber Alerts’ AND ‘Apple Watch’ products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an ‘Amber Alert’ is active.

Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, ‘Emergency Plus’ could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etc…) to anybody in the affected area… As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.

‘Emergency Plus’ is an invaluable application to install on one’s smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (“draft”) application… Whilst I’m sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms.",2,22-03-2022,,

Ava0Q,"Just downloaded app & love that it has a street address shown on a map AND lat/long displayed PLUS degree of accuracy (within 65m for example). While 000 may ask for cross streets, these can be seen on the map in built up areas. And having lat/long is better than nothing in remote or rural areas, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe we need to upgrade our 000 responders so they have the ability to view lat/long on a map or vehicle GPS. Given the huge areas that don't have street addresses, lat/long is necessary at times.",5,08-02-2017,,
Maggiemg22,"I was showing my mother this app saying how it was a great idea. She thought so too but her feedback was that the coordinates were very small and difficult to read, especially if you were in an emergency situation and feeling dizzy etc. It looks like there is room to make the co-ordinates larger and perhaps black on white text would be easier to read especially for older people or if you're glasses have been lost/broken in an accident.

Display ""Great Eastern Highway, 300m North of Evans Street"" or ""Willy Rd, 200m South of High St"".  Most people attending an emergency aren't near home and haven't any idea of where or what the name of the nearest cross street is.  I know cause I had the same issue in the Blue Mountains once.

To be able to search in areas and get real-time information.

Multilingual support and selectable in settings.

For example, the app ""always open"" is in that list. For that app, I can choose to define ""never"", ""ask next time I share"", ""when using the app"" or ""always"". SOS alarms are not in the same list.

I have restarted the device but that doesn't fix the problem.

I get an error message in the SOS alarm app that ""the app only works correctly if it has access to location"".

at ""settings""-""privacy and security""-""location services""-""share my location info"" I get a sys modal alert stating ""Share my location info not available. Unable to connect to the server.

However, these deactivated ones do not receive any result regarding finding my location when using maps such as Eniro, SL, Maps.Me, Kartor and Sverigetaxi.

I have unlimited data. I have internet connection.

The phone is set in Lockdown mode. Uses that setting because, among other things, it disables JIT compilation for Javascript. Bugs in the JIT are exploited by 45% of all Malware that attacks devices via a browser. I've only experienced trouble with one app before due to lock down mode and that's the Line app. Then the text message that you need to verify the number is not sent. However, I received that text message when registering in SOS Alarm. Even Instagram's automatic login by recognizing the device after reinstalling the app doesn't work, so you have to enter the password the first time you use that app. Otherwise, I don't experience any problems except that some fonts in browsers that refer to icons become squares, but this only indicates that the web developer is deplorable in that they need frameworks and Google fonts etc. so that they don't have a good grasp of what they really are has under the hood.

Under ""settings"" - ""privacy and security"" analysis and improvements"" all settings are disabled.

I am in Sweden.

ISP Tele2.

I am not connected to an Access Point ie router + switch.

I'm not connected to a VPN. VPN is under settings ""not connected"" and the program that refers to VPN is completely turned off and not started after reboot.

I haven't tested whether the SOS alarm works if you deactivate Lockdown mode because then I get Pegasus right away. A device that is in lockdown mode is probably extra interesting, so now I don't dare turn it off, even though I'm an uninteresting person.

I give one star because there is no information about the app not working in ""Lockdown mode""

That is, if you have chosen to share your location all the time, you are not only visible when you use the app yourself in the event of an accident, but you can also be found if you yourself disappear due to an accident/crime where SOS can track you after a police report has been made.

Now the position may already be shared regardless, but if you want to be able to be tracked even though you don't report an accident, for example, but have been hit yourself, then you have to agree to it, right?

A Google user,"The application needs to be ""swipe killed"" to save the phone number. Either force closing it or ""backing"" out of seems to make the saving fail for whatever reason. It would be nice if you'd display a warning that it won't suspend and keep using the GPS location until the battery dies, unless it is swipe killed. I understand that you don't want it to be suspended before the location is sent, but you could at least provide a clear way to kill the application. It would also eliminate my first problem. I would personally never have noticed that my phone number wasn't saved and found a ""work around"" if it hadn't killed my battery. Not something you want to fiddle with in case of an emergency. Finally, 42 MB... why? So you didn't have to touch Java? I suppose all versions run on QT and they don't need to be certified individually, but judging from the quality the certification process can't be very thorough. The mobile applications seem really simple so I can't justify the size and load time/splash screen compared, well, native applications of acceptable quality.

The phone number is asked again every time (obvious bug), the installation package has a size of 12 megabytes, which significantly raises the threshold to download this over 2G, for example, at a cottage (this cannot be explained by anything other than the fixation to shove that Qt everywhere, even with the threat that the size of the software approx. 20-fold) and for some strange reason, a splash screen is forcibly displayed every time at startup, which probably warms the mind at the point when you have managed to cut your leg and bleed to death. I don't care at all if this kind of garbage is sold to private customers for millions, but at the point when such a critical public service, the failure of which is paid for at worst in human lives, is implemented in such a totally unprofessional manner, it starts to bother me, to put it mildly.

And if you try to transfer the application to the memory card, then the size of the application will already increase to closer to 70 megabytes 2. Why does the application need permission, e.g. phone contacts, photos, videos and other files, or monitoring network connections, not to mention access to the memory card? 3. The number query that opens when the application starts cannot save a number. 4. Who has location services eating up the battery on the 247? and Battery usage: High.. Apparently, the application polls its location somewhere inside the for loop a thousand times per second and drains the battery in an instant. 5. When opening, an advertisement box opens, which you have to wait for to close 6. The application does not even have its own Dialer.
