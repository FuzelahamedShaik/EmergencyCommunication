,Norwegian in Wiesn,"The idea behind this app is superb, and a must for anyone traveling abroad. Nevertheless, it has several shortcomings that are easy to correct and will thus be able to raise the quality of the next updated version. Some immediate tips for improvement:
1) The overview of all sailors' churches should contain GPS coordinates, so it is easy to find when arriving by car.
2) Incomplete addresses for the sailors' churches. Some are listed only with a street address - and nothing else.
3) The overview should be listed by country, and with the individual churches in subcategories. As it is now, it's a little country and a little places/cities, and it's inconsistent. For example, the church in ""Antwerp"" is inside, while further down you find ""Belgium"".

In summary: The principle behind the app is brilliant, but a good revision is needed and the next version will be gold :) Good luck!",4,2013-09-05,
,Tulltur,The only thing missing was that the name of companies where I have travel insurance was missing from the list. AIG did not exist.,4,2013-09-04,
