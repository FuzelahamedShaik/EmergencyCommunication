JJ_84,"It was fine to call through the program, but the positioning does not work as it should. Gave wrong location information.",3,2016-01-18
Yulmur,"Really, this location should be on all the time to work during an emergency call. However, this consumes the battery considerably, so it should not be kept on. In the moment of emergency, in a state of shock, the positioning did not work for this reason, and on top of that, I advised the fire department in the wrong direction. Fortunately, passers-by quickly corrected the situation and we got the right direction to the emergency center.

I wish the positioning would work when using the application.",3,2019-05-26
Olli 12345,"A clear and well-functioning application! Thank you !

NOTE EVERYONE: Despite the wording of the settings, positioning is NOT on all the time! Only the always selection is so that the positioning would work when an emergency call is in progress!",5,2016-02-16
samikki,"The call is successful through the application. The location has not been tested as such an emergency has not occurred yet.

For those who want a ""not in the background"" option for location, have you realized that during an emergency call, the application moves to the background when the phone application becomes active? Then even positioning wouldn't work if it was prohibited in the background.

The battery consumption caused by the application can be monitored under ""Battery"" in the settings. From there you can clearly see that this application does not consume the battery. If you have tested the program, you will naturally see a small amount of use there. Under normal circumstances, an unused application does not consume the battery at all.",4,2016-04-11
Keksimonsteri,"For some reason, the push notification notification cannot be found anywhere in the application, and it does not open when the notification is tapped. Wouldn't it be good to have them readable somewhere, if it is swept away from the notification center?

In addition, the order of the announcements on the announcements tab is somehow random, and you can't rearrange them. Wouldn't it be nice to have the latest ones at the top right away?",3,2021-01-26
Henkka V.,"iOS 12 and later versions support sending location information during an emergency call anyway, so the only significant additional benefit of this app is receiving local emergency notifications. For that, however, the application requires unrestricted access to the GPS location, which it also uses diligently (at the expense of the battery). More harm than good, in my opinion.",2,2020-01-29
Virittäjä,"Location is of course a great thing and in many cases it helps a lot, but the application could also have the user's basic information.

Locating to an apartment building with a business connection does not yet lead to/bring the emergency services there.

Similarly, there could be a place for information about the user's basic illnesses and medications, so that the emergency center would immediately have all the relevant information available.",4,2016-02-11
Harmin paikka,I wondered for a couple of days why the iPhone 7's battery is dwindling at a tremendous rate. Then I checked the situation in the battery settings and I was surprised: the 112 application has been running in the background for more than 20 hours during the day and has consumed 65% of the battery's energy. This error must be corrected!,2,2019-11-24
Digipoju,"The iOS interface could be used for danger notifications, so that the notifications are received even when the phone is on silent/do not disturb mode.

mcjori,"but the ads are mostly irrelevant. Push notification for every service interruption and traffic bulletin 100km away? As a rule of thumb, 112 messages should only be about critical, pressing matters.",2,2021-02-22
Kivakaveri,"Despite previous evaluations, the application does consume battery in the background. This obviously depends on how much you move during the day. On some days, there has been 40 min of background activity. and then sometimes only 2 min. Could it be because of those ""local notices"" that you have to apply for them again in each location? The consumption is still not massive, but there are apps with similar features that don't use the battery that much.",3,2019-04-27
Skuattis,"Same problem as others, the app is active in the background almost all the time and has become the biggest battery consumer along with heavy games. Forced to limit location rights",2,2020-02-02
javitutole,"Location always on?! The battery runs out of this. Before the hazard notice flashing, positioning was on, only when using the App... They ruined a handy app with this flashing?! BAD !",1,2019-12-05
Tzar5846,"Battery consumption has gotten out of control with the version update. The app, which used to spend a quiet life, now consumes 50% of the iPhone 7's battery during 8 hours of the night. You can also check this in Settings: 112 Finland, Background location",2,2019-10-13
Simo J.,"In version 2.0.4 background activity and with this the battery usage has gone wild according to the battery usage view of the phone settings. And the application's settings still cannot prohibit the use of background tracking for official announcements, so the application cannot be used to locate emergency calls only in the background of the call.

In addition, danger information experiments have not been received even once, so doubts arise about their operation in real situations.

When asking for location permission, the explanation is incomplete, because location during calls is not mentioned. This should be the most important function of the application, so there is a risk that users will not pay attention to this and will only allow positioning when using the application.",2,2019-10-12

Karppal,"I deleted the app when the battery drains. During the night, the application has been running in the background for more than 12 hours and used 51% of the battery alone. There's no use in having an emergency call app that causes you to run out of battery power to call in an emergency.",1,2019-10-12
hhenuliini,"This is the kind of app that I can recommend to everyone and I especially recommend that parents download it for their own children! I myself have (unfortunately) had to use this in the event of a work accident and this application pinpointed the location very accurately. I wouldn't have remembered the address myself in that situation and I wouldn't even have been able to check it anywhere because of my physical incapacity, but thanks to this application, the personal information was loaded automatically and the ambulance found the place quickly.

Daily user moving to vimeo,"Apparently intended only for the owner of the latest model phone. Or how do I know if this program works as it should when I have an iPhone 5. The App store offers an update, but it doesn't do that, and it says that the version is not suitable for my phone.

There is also nowhere to tell how the functionality of the program's location is if you use VPN protection, for example F-secure's Freedome.",2,2018-03-14
Zoppaz,"NOTE EVERYONE: it really eats battery and a lot. I was surprised when the battery wears out so quickly and I thought that the phone is just getting so old that the battery has worn out. But then I remembered that I installed this program. After removal, the battery consumption is unchanged again. For some reason that battery consumption doesn't show up in the weapons section. But let everyone experience it for themselves. And if that increased battery consumption doesn't bother someone, then this is a great app. You never know when you'll need a blanket. But unusable for me like this.",1,2017-06-06
Oh7lzb,"The app requires location access at all times, and does not offer the normal option of only accessing location when the app is used (in case of emergency).

JVI-TKI,"With location information ""always on"", the app sends location information more than 800 times during 3 days. That is, almost every fifth minute. Not like this.

NOTE EVERYONE: Contrary to what is falsely claimed in the comments here, location information is REALLY being sent continuously even if you don't use the app! That's the only way regional hazard notices can work.

In addition, when making a normal emergency call without an app, the phones automatically send location information to the emergency center using AML, so this App is no longer needed to share the location.

The only benefit of this app is danger notifications, but even for that there is a built-in function maintained by Apple in Apple devices, if the Alarm Center would only realize to use it, and not waste money on maintaining this, at best, mediocre App.

Tissiposki,Gps positioning needs to be changed so that it only uses location data when the application is open.,4,2016-01-22
hoe666,"Softa seems good and certainly does what it says. It's nice to think that he gets information about the location if he doesn't know it himself or can tell... Then it's mandatory but...

Softa hangs a bit unnecessarily actively on the GPS and this consumes the battery. You can't choose from the settings to update the location at a specified time interval or only when the program is open... Now it feels like the program updates the location all the time... As if the battery capacity is too much

Because of this, I mostly think of deleting the software because if you are on a trip, it would be nice to be able to call the emergency center there and not see when the software has sucked the battery dry...

In addition, I was thinking that the software could not send the location to the emergency center by text message and not by data connection? The information would be delivered more reliably... So this is when you call there... Not just to be sure...

So development is still required before this can be called good... The idea is great.",1,2015-10-06

aatte,Presumably a working application (fortunately there has not been a situation where you could properly test it) but a bit unfinished. Visually quite harsh and possibly increases the risk of accidentally calling the emergency number. Many seem to complain that positioning is always on. Location is only on if the app is in use or is running in the background. Close the app and the location will also be turned off. It is understandable that the app sends the location even though it is in the background.,1,2015-09-20

Pirjo77,"A really unfinished looking piece; the user interface and the font do not scale in any way according to the screen size (e.g. on an iPhone 6 plus it looks absolutely terrible).

You cannot choose the coordinate system yourself, so this application would be useful for more than just emergencies.

The application wants to use the location even when it is not in the foreground. Why? And promise to tell the reason in English when asking about this. Why? Of course, almost everyone knows the language this well, but it is nevertheless an application intended for very local use.

The only positive is the ease of calling other emergency numbers, such as the poison control center. Would it be possible to develop that positioning only when using the program? Otherwise a good application",4,2015-07-07

Vihainen lokki,"I installed the application for the whole family, definitely a good tool. It helps tremendously, for example, when calling for help at the scene of an accident or when injured on a geocaching trip.

The location really stays on and eats up the battery very quickly, especially in older phones. Of course, this is not a big problem in practice, as we all hope to never need the app. After the first launch, it is important to close the application, exiting it is not enough. This bug should be fixed soon, because at worst, the application made to make it easier to get help prevents it when the battery is completely empty.",1,2015-06-23
